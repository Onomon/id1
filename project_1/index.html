        <h1>Intro</h1>
        <p>My favorite artist a newer artist by the name of RUDE. He's a Minnesota based artist that produces oriental styled music that, in my opinion, conveys a certain emotion with each song.</p>
        <h1>About RUDE</h1>
        <p>RUDE got his inspiration to do music from early dubstep artists of 2010, it gave him a sort of motivation to start making his own music. His style emerged from listening to the music his mother played around the house as he grew up. The vast difference in the styling of the music ranged from oriental to slightly tribal in sound, this influenced the musical styling he currently possesses.</p>
        <h1>Musical History</h1>

        <p>Though RUDE is a fairly new artist, his discography starts in early 2015 with the <i>Old Glory EP</i>, which used a more ethnic approach to the sound. Then in 2016 he really picked up the pace in terms of musical releases; Starting with the Naruto Remixes EP. Released in January, The EP does remixes of three popular songs from the Naruto series OST. Later in summer of 2016, he created the <i>Eternal Summer EP</i>, an EP to celebrate summer in whole.

        His latest Ep, <i>Forever Lotus</i>, Is a bit more somber in tone yet is still just as impactful in terms of the music created.<iframe width="100%" height="1000px" scrolling="no" frameborder="yes" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/284358437&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=true"></iframe>
        He's currently working on another EP as of writing this hopefully with more to follow. </p>
        <h1>My Take</h1>
        <p>I very much enjoy the artist and the music he creates ever since I found out about him in summer of 2016 with the <i>Eternal Summer EP</i> and I've been following ever since. Personally, my favorite track is Eternal Youth. It's my favorite track due to the feelings that the song conveys for me personally, especially the feeling of longing for my own youthful summers.</p>
