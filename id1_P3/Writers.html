           <p>The floor shreiked as Abby's weight let off of the floorboards as she made her way through the home. Her eyes dart back and forth at the slightest indication of movement from tattered curtains or the sligtest squeak from the floorboards; all the while her breathing becomes slightly more erratic as she feels the hallways clossing in on her. a slight brush across the base of her neck is enough to send her running deeper into the house screaming at the top of her lungs; she calms down as she reaches the atrium and looks around with her flashlight. It shines slightly on a portrait of a woman, the painting ripped at what would be her jaw. As she opens her mouth in awe her jaw drops off of her face as if mirroring the image in front of her.</p>

            <p>His shadow dances across the hardwood floor of his apartment as he paces in anticipation; his murmers accompany the vicious tapping of his shoes as he makes his way from one wall to the next. The door of a room opens and the silhoutte of a woman casts over him almost stopping his stride immediately; her black hair cascades down past her shoulders and onto her porcelain like skin, her brown eyes shine with a firelike undertone as she steps into the room with Travis. She gently pushes her hair out of her face and tucks it behind her ear as before looking at her partner of fourteen years;
            "Pick up your jaw Romeo, it's time for our date>", she says with a smile reflecting equal parts flattery and gratification.</p>

            <p> A girl sits in a chair in the middle of an almost perfectly white room, she wears a white dress with frills adorning the bottom, white gloves, black shoes with gold buckles, and a red headband that fits perfectly on her blonde hair. She sits there perfectly still as the sounds of a digital camera's shutter echoes through the room, her brown eyes dull and listless. Two men stand behind the camera; “That's right smile for us, for you are and always will be, our perfect little doll.”, the girl gives a gentle barbie like smile as a single tear rolls down her cheek. A doorbell is heard and the two men turn around as the door opens JT is on the other side; “Morning Master Quinn!", Quinn stands opposite of him rubbing his eyes, “JT, I keep telling you, drop the whole master thing and just call me Quinn.” he says with a yawn coming through at the end. </p>
