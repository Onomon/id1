            <!--Question 1-->
            <li><strong>Describe the fonts used as headers, paragraphs, and pull quotes.</strong></li>
            <p>Legible, thought the feelings the type gives off are somewhat confusing to say the least. It's definitely not a happy feeling though, like that of something aging.</p>
            <!--Question 2-->
            <li><strong>Describe the color palette. What colors are used? Where and how are specific colors used?</strong></li>
            <p>The color palette is a very muted one, outside of the maroon and used in certain places like the pull quote at the beginning of the page and the footer at the end there's, very little color outside of the blue of the sly in certain photos. other colors used were eggshell whites and different tones of grey to lead the eye and make things stand out.</p>
            <!--Question 3-->
            <li><strong>What role do the visuals play? When and how are visuals used?</strong></li>
            <p>In certain areas it seems as if the visuals are used to break up the content a bit, to make it so you aren't just reading this long passage without break. After certain areas of text a visual is dropped in to give the eye a rest for a moment, almost as if to not overwhelm the reader.</p>
            <!--Question 4-->
            <li><strong>How are sections separated? What are the visual cues?</strong></li>
            <p>The sections are separated using visuals that span the entire screen, giving the reader a noticeable place to stop reading to take in the sight of the website.</p>
