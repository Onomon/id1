            <h4>About me</h4>
            <p>My path to becoming a designer started in Architectual Design, but due to the amount of stress that it put on me I switched Over to Graphic Design as an alternative. While I was still in Highschool I began to open my eyes more and wanted to persue a career in Design and began to try and find a focus of what I did best, I found my calling at the time was in screen printing and simple sign and T-shirt designs which solidified the path that I wanted to take in life for me. Now I'm persuing a career in Graphic design as well as attempting my hand at broadcasting. </p>
            <p>If anything as a designer I'd like to be able to communicate through my design, more specifically I'd like to be able to make design that can click with people regardless of their language and transcend nations. It's part of the reason I adopted a minimalist style, to get across a message through feeling rather than tell you what it's meant to convey through words; Things like the Ribbons to support for a spcific illness, the Red Cross, or Nike. I would like to persue Design like this but to push a message.</p>
