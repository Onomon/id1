        <h1><strong>The state of the world today</strong></h1>
        <p>I like the World in the fact that we live in an age of technology. We can conduct business across the world through the internet as well as build friendships that span countries.Life is really good in terms of living and perspective. </p>
        <p>I hate tension driven by malicious intent. While I get that not all people can get along and it's those differences that make us human, I just want  to see the news broadcast peaceful demonstrations over riots when it comes to protest. Or not broadcasting as much death would be cool.</p>
        <p>I wish I could change the amount of communication we actually do as a world. All this technology and talking out differences is one of the hardest things we face currently. Yeah the world isn't perfect and language barriers exist, but I'm an optimist.</p>
