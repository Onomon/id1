            <li><strong>Describe the fonts used as headers, paragraphs, and pull quotes.</strong></li>
            <p>The header, as well as the pull quotes and drop caps, use a script like font that looks handmade. This gives the webpage a human touch to it's design. Despite this unique touch the body text is mostly a standard clean cut type.</p>
            <li><strong>Describe the color palette. What colors are used? where and how arespecific colors used?</strong></li>
