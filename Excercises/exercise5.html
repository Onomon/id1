                    <li>What adjectives would you use to describe Bethany's Portfolio?
                    Simple and to the point, it's full of her personality and speaks about her not only as a designer but as a person.</li>
                    <li>Describe the design of the navigation.
                    It's to the point, there's nothing frilly or unnecessary about it. it's got basic links that feel like links as well as links to her works and amusing. Other than that it's just the basic information she provides.</li>
                    <li>Describe the design of the introductory information.
                    It draws in attention and gradually becomes smaller while also implementing her own brand of humor to keep you slightly into it. It's as if she were talking to you rather than having you read this.</li>
                    <li>Describe the layout & design of the body content.
                    I've used this term a lot but simple, yet effective. It differs enough from the body content that it's able to make it's own stake yet you have to visually work your way down to it.</li>
                    <li>describe the design of the footer.
                    Pretty cool, it has links to her Instagram as well as twitter and  dribble whatever that is. there's also a link to what appears to be another creative site entirely, every small graphic appears to be it's own thing.</li>
                </ol>

                <ol>
                    <li>How has the navigation changed?
                    The navigation items have been put away into a drop down menu and the text size has been increased as well as had an effect to alter opacity slapped onto it</li>
                    <li>How has the size of the headline text changed?
                    It's now much smaller and compact so that it all fits onto the screen without the need to scroll, It's also been scaled down in comparison to the body text so it doesn't seem nearly as big.</li>
                    <li>How has the size of the body text change?It still feels small in comparison to what's going on around it, but it feels like nothing much has changed aside from the obvious change to a mobile layout.</li>
                    <li>How does the layout of the content change?
                    It's much more streamline and reduced in size to fit into the palm of your hand while also making sure not to sacrifice the vision of the designer.</li>
                    <li>How does the layout of the footer change?The links are more organized and stacked to where they all collect at the bottom of the screen in the center of the phone.</li>

                    <li>What adjectives would you use to describe Olivia's portfolio?
                    Sectional, it's divided off based on sections and is very organized at a glance</li>
                    <li>Describe the layout & Design of the introductory section.
                    It first shows her name then position followed by a paragraph giving basic information about her. It's laid out so it's easy to take in with a separation from her main points.</li>
                    <li>Describe the layout & design of the portfolio entries.
                    It's laid out into sections that you scroll through with each section given it's own color and distinct feel based on the tone of the project.</li>
                    <li>Describe the layout & design of the footer.
                    Very simple with basic links to her social media, email, and telephone oddly enough. though I assume it's a work phone for official jobs.</li>

                <ol>
                    <li>How does the layout of the introductory section change?
                    Everything is in line more so than it was before, it occupys that blue square with all of her job information and a small description of her experience since she began design. But now all of it is smaller and modified to mobile.</li>
                    <li>How does the layout of the portfolio entries change?
                    <strong>It doesn't really change much from the desk site giving you all of the visual cue that the mobile experience does, by color coating the projects that she has done and giving a small description before showing the finished product, though now the site's pictures are put into columns.</strong></li>

                <ol>
                    <li>Describe the layout of the website.
                    <strong>It's very simple yet kind of awesome due to the fact that the links that he has change the entirety of the site. Other than that at first glance without really moving around the site comes off as slightly underwhelming.</strong></li>
                    <li>Describe the design of website. How does Danito indicate hierarchy?<strong>The design is simple, there's not a lot to say there but the heirarchy is done by collumns going from left to right. It starts with his name and contact info followed by his specialties, then it gets into the projects and that's where thesite shines in my opinion.</strong></li>
                    <li>How does the layout change?
                    <strong>The layout changes by making everything white and making it so clicking onto the links sends you to the page where the color shifts after scrolling. It also lets you go back to the previous page while the project you were looking at scrolls in the background.</strong></li>
                    <li>How does the size of the text change?
                    <strong>I didn't see much of a noticible change honestly.</strong></li>
