            <li><strong>Describe the fonts used as headers, paragraphs, and pull quotes.</strong></li>
            <p>The font used for the header was very powerful as well as bold, while the fonts used in the pull qoutes were very elegant and subdued compared to that of the title. The fonts used in the paragraphs were vfery basic and par for the course in terms of documents, a basic legible font.</p>
            <li><strong>Describe the color palette. what colors are used? Where and how are the specific colors used?</strong></li>
            <p>The color palette is constantly changing as you scroll throughout the page, going from a more subdued palette using muted colors when talking about her and when using pull quotes. While the warmer tones were used when talking about her personal life.</p>
            <li><strong>What role do the visuals play? When and how are visuals used?</strong></li>
            <p>The visuals are very powerful in that they relate with the text that they go with to the point that the text would be less impactful without the imagery to accompany it.</p>
            <li><strong>How are sections seperated what are the visual cues?</strong></li>
            <p>Sections are seperated by the use of colors and visuals. One section may have a powerful image of Monae taking up the entire webpage with a diamond and a pull quote, while another may be just the text split evenly with a visual of Monae along the side of it </p>
