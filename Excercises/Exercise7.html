            <h1>Exercise 7: Website Analysis</h1>
            <h2>96 Elephants</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>What adjectives would use to describe the design of this site? A:The site is actually kind of monotone and kind of casts a feel of sadness and casts a sort of dread over the viewer at what the contnet may be.</li>
                <li>Describe how the navigation for this "Story" works. A: The story goes in a straight forward fashion showing images to lead the eye and then the text to the left of the actual information, you continue to scroll through until you hit  a sort of ending that sends you to the next chapter of the story.</li>
                <li>How does the ending for Chapter 3 differ from the other two chapters? A: It sort of leaves the story in your hands by asking you to make a donation to protect the elephants or by going to the regions where they are being hunted to help stop the hunt of elephants. It truly involves you into the story rather than just giving you information about the topic and leaving it be.</li>
                <li>What do you think the creators of this site hoped to accomplish? A: First was to raise awareness of the fact that elephants play a crucial role in our ecosystem as a whole as well as raise attention that they are being needlessly hunted for the vanity of others because of their Ivory tusks; Second was to raise awareness of the relief campaign for the elephants by showing then askinf them for help. Tird was to get donations to help these por animals.</li>
            </ol>
            <h2>Elizabeth River Trail</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>What adjectives would use to describe the design of this site? A: Clean, Crisp, Open; it's sort of like a brocure for the explore part inviting you to look around the river walk while the second part is more so a call to action.</li>
                <li>Describe how the navigation works. A: Well it kind of varies really as it's not really much of a navigation more so clicking on links and having a look for yourself, he navogation for explore shows you the area that you'd be in via a map view and some pictures which helpm you get into a mind set of your surroundings. It doesn't really put much of an emphasis on the call to action and you can kind of avoid it all together.</li>
                <li>Do the names of the navigation page seem appropriate for the content of these pages? A: well yes as each link gives you a depiction of that part of the site and gives a reason for it to be there.</li>
                <li>What do you think the creators of this site hoped to accomplish? a: more so awareness of the river walk and that it's back into a useable shape. Other than that t asks fpr volunteers to keep the riverwalk safe and clesn for everyone.</li>
